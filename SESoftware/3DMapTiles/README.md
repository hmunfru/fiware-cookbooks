3D-Map-Tiles Cookbook
==================
This cookbook installs the 3D-Map-Tiles Specific enabler. This SE provides an interface to query map data from different sources, e.g. Open Streetmap or a GIS Data Provider, and assemble a tile-based map from it.
The map tiles provider comes with an HTTP interface that allows to request specific tiles by x, y and zoom-values

Requirements
------------
The Map-Tiles provider is a php application that has the following requirements:

- `apache2` : Webserver to host the application
- `php5` : To execute the PHP scripts
- `git` : To checkout the map tiles provider repository 

All dependencies should be installed automatically by the recipe, if not already available on the node
